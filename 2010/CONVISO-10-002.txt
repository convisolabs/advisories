[CONVISO-10-002] - cform WordPress Plugin V 11.5 Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

1. Advisory Information
    Conviso Advisory ID: CONVISO-10-002
    CVE ID: CVE-2010-3977
    CVSS v2: 5.7
    Date: 2010-07-24

2. Affected Components
    File lib_ajax.php on version 11.5.

3. Description
    Created and distributed by Delicious Days (http://www.deliciousdays.com/), cforms is a rich form
    plugin for WordPress, offering deployment of multiple Ajax driven contact forms throughout
    user's blog or even on the same page. An issue on version 11.5 allows the exploit of a Cross
    Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and the consequent capability of client-side attacks for data
    leaking and malware propagation.

4. Details
    The file lib_ajax.php on version 11.5 creates a data array with all values inserted on the
    form's fields on a POST requisition. As there is no data validation of the rs and rsargs
    parameters, it is possible to inject malformed data by Javascript.
