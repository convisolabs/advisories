[CONVISO-13-001] - Spree Commerce Multiple Unsafe Reflection Vulnerabilities

1. Advisory Information
    Conviso Advisory ID: CONVISO-13-001
    CVE ID: CVE-2013-1656
    CVSS v2: 4.7, (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C)
    Date: 2013-03-01

2. Affected Components
    Spree Commerce >= 1.0.0

3. Description
    Spree Commerce [1] is "a 100% open source e-commerce platform powered by the popular Ruby on
    Rails framework. It was designed to make customization and upgrades as simple as possible".
    Multiple Unsafe Reflection [2] vulnerabilities have been found on it that affected any version
    >= 1.0.0.

4. Details
    Unsafe Reflection vulnerabilities occur in Rails generally when the one of the following methods
    is called with user-controlled data: String#constantize, String#safe_constantize,
    Module#const_get, Module#qualified_const_get[2][3]. These methods take a string and try to find
    a constant with the name specified. When this occurs, then the attacker can change the
    application control flow in ways not intended by the developer. This can lead to several forms
    of attack, such as enumeration of classes and methods, enumeration of files and directories and
    command injection.

    Four occurrences of this vulnerability were found in the Spree source code, within the
    administrator interface. Below you can see the vulnerable pieces of code obtained from Spree
    1.3.2:

    File: core/app/controllers/spree/admin/payment_methods_controller.rb
    10    @payment_method =
    params[:payment_method].delete(:type).constantize.new(params[:payment_method])

    File: promo/app/controllers/spree/admin/promotion_actions_controller.rb
    5     @promotion_action = params[:action_type].constantize.new(params[:promotion_action])

    File: promo/app/controllers/spree/admin/promotion_rules_controller.rb
    9     promotion_rule_type = params[:promotion_rule].delete(:type)
    10    @promotion_rule = promotion_rule_type.constantize.new(params[:promotion_rule])

    File: promo/app/controllers/spree/admin/promotions_controller.rb
    10    calculator_type = params[:promotion].delete(:calculator_type)
    11    @promotion = Promotion.new(params[:promotion])
    12    if calculator_type
    13    @promotion.calculator = calculator_type.constantize.new


    A Proof of Concept demonstrating command injection for the second occurrence is shown below:

5. Solution
    A safe way to use the String#constantize method is to apply a whitelist check over the string
    before the call to ensure that an allowed class/module will be constantized. The vendor has
    provided patches that fix the flaws. [4]
